# Course 1: Linux Commands — The 95 Percent (Beginner to Job Ready)

This course is designed to take a complete beginner from “never touched Linux” to “job-ready for cloud engineering and Linux administration in common scenarios.”

It focuses on the most frequently used commands and workflows that cover the majority of real-world tasks. The goal is not to memorize everything, but to understand patterns and build muscle memory.
